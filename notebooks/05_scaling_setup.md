In the next step, we use a Dask cluster in the cloud. One option for doing so, is to use [coiled.io](https://www.coiled.io/). 
Coiled can be used with AWS, Azure or a GCP account. The advantage is that one does not have to bother about the installation of the infrastructure for scaling. 
**Disclaimer:** I do not work for coiled nor is this is advertisement :blush:.

Till recently, it was possible to use Microsoft's Planetary Computer but this option has been stopped (please see Github discussion [here](https://github.com/microsoft/PlanetaryComputer/discussions/347)),

The following material is based on the following script [here](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/cluster.html) from the [stackstac](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) and the coiled.io documentation ([source 1](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/setup/index.html)), (LINK 2 TO ADD) and (LINK 3 TO ADD).

In the example below, the setup using an AWS cloud account is used. The code is run a Windows 10 computer. 

## 1. Prerequisites - Please skip to part 2 if you have this already.
